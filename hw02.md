1)Information is any entity or form that provides the answer to a question of some kind or 
resolves uncertainty. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed 
to pameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concept.

2）Positional notation or place-value notation is a method of representing or encoding numbers. 
Positional notation is distinguished from other notations (such as Roman numerals) for its use of 
the same symbol for the different orders of magnitude (for example, the "ones place", "tens place", 
"hundreds place").

3）In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to 
solve a class of problems.

4）A software bug is an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it 
to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways.
