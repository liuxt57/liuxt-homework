## Method of complements

In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one 
number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in 
mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers. 

## Byte

The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing 
a binary number. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character 
of text in a computer[1][2] and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in 
many computer architectures. 

## Integer (computer science)

In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some 
range of mathematical integers. Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be 
allowed to contain negative values. Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of 
binary digits (bits). The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies 
between different types of computers. Computer hardware, including virtual machines, nearly always 
provide a way to represent a processor register or memory address as an integer.

## Floating point

In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real 
numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision.
