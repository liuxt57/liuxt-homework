输入设备，存储器，运算器，控制器，输出设备

## 2.A computer has 64  (megaytes) of memory How many its are needed to address any single byte in memory？

The memory address space is 64 MB, or 2^6*2^20 = 2^26. This means you need 26 bits to adress each byte.

## 3.List basic parts of a CPU, include cache or not ?

CPU includes  Control Unit, Arithmetic Logic Unit and Memory Unit. Yes, it belongs to Moemory Uint.

## 4.What mean secondary storage? List some on your PC.

Secondary storage (二级存储设备，辅助存储器)， is a non-volatile memory (does not lose stored data when the device is powered down) that is not directly accessible by the CPU, because it is not accessed via the input/output channels (it is an external device). In RAM devices (as flash memory) data can be directly deleted or changed.

- Flash memory(闪存)：An electronic non-volatile computer storage device that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed, and works without any moving parts. Examples of this are flash drives(闪存驱动器), memory cards（存储卡） and solid state drives（固态驱动器）. A version of this is implemented in many notebook and some desktop computers.

-  Optical discs（光盘）：激光读取和写入数据的存储介质。光盘可以存储更多数据 - 比大多数便携式磁介质（如软盘）高出6千兆字节。有三种基本类型的光盘：CD / DVD / BD-ROM（只读），WORM（一次写入多次读取）和EO（可擦除光盘）。

- Magnetic disks（磁盘）：磁盘是由涂有磁化材料的金属或塑料构成的圆形板。使用磁盘的两侧并且可以在一个主轴上堆叠多个磁盘，每个表面上具有读/写头。比特沿着被称为轨道的同心圆中的点存储在磁化表面上。轨道通常分为称为扇区的部分。永久连接且偶尔用户无法移除的磁盘称为硬盘。带有可移动磁盘的磁盘驱动器称为软盘驱动器。

- Magnetic tapes（磁带）：磁带传输由电气，机械和电子元件组成，为磁带单元提供部件和控制机制。胶带本身是涂有磁记录介质的塑料条。比特沿着几个轨道记录在磁带上的磁点。记录七或九位以与奇偶校验位一起形成字符。读/写磁头安装在每个磁道中，以便可以记录数据并将其作为一系列字符读取。

## 5.使用维基百科，解释以下概念：

1) CPU:

A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s.[1] Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.

2) RAM(Random-access memory):

Random-access memory is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. In contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory, the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.

3) ROM(Read-Only Memory)

Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM can only be modified slowly, with difficulty, or not at all, so it is mainly used to store firmware (software that is closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to need frequent updates) or application software in plug-in cartridges.

4. Bus(computing)(总线)：

In computer architecture, a bus[1] (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fiber, etc.) and software, including communication protocols.

5. Parallel Computing（并行运算） ：

Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has long been employed in high-performance computing, but it's gaining broader interest due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.

## 6.解释“云计算（cloud computing）”。

云计算是一种按使用量付费的模式，这种模式提供可用的、便捷的、按需的网络访问， 进入可配置的计算资源共享池（资源包括网络，服务器，存储，应用软件，服务），这些资源能够被快速提供，只需投入很少的管理工作，或与服务供应商进行很少的交互。


## 7.小孙买了计算机主板，说明书表明“支持双通道DDR3-1333内存，最大支持16G”。

1. DDR3内存，“3”表示第三代双倍数据率同步动态随机存取存储器的“第三代”，“1333”表示频率。

2. 小孙买了8G DDR3-1600的内存能提高性能吗？

    不能，因为主板最大频率为1333，不能达到1600.

3. 小孙买了4G*2 DDR3-1333的内存能提供性能吗？

      能。

4. 16G需要多少位地址？

    2^4 * 2^30= 2^34, 需要34位。
